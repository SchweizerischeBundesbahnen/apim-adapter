# Rewrite rules
# Note: By default the proxy passes the requests to the default host configured in the API-Management.
# If rewrite is omitted, location will be used in the request to the backend. If proxyPass is omitted,
# request will be rewritten using the rewrite pattern and sent to the host configured in API-Management.
# Important: The settings above are applied for each backend host individually.

#rules:
#  - location: ^/some/(.*)/location/match$
#    rewrite: /the/$1/new/location
#    proxyPass: http://my.backend.location
